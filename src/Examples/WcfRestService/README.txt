This is an example project of using Ninject from a WCF REST Web Service based on the
"WCF REST Service Template 40(CS)" found here:
http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/fbc7e5c1-a0d2-41bd-9d7b-e54c845394cd?SRC=VSIDE

This template requires Visual Studio 2010 and .NET 4.0

NOTE - This example is based on the version of Ninject that is currently under development.  It will not work 
with the stable 2.2 version without changes.  Until the next version is released (2.4?), you will need to get compatible versions of 
each Ninject library this example depends on from the teamcity site (http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project3&tab=projectOverview)
or build the whole thing from source.
